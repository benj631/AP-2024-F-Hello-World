# Overview

Simple demonstration of Hello World in python.

This uses the print function, sleep function, and exit function.

I created this software to show "Hello World!" on the terminal.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I only used a txt file that was renamed .py to make this.

This uses vanilla python only.
